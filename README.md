// SmugAware_v2
// Updated iOS Code for Swift

// This code emulates the same thing as the ObjC code, only it's in Swift. Also, it uses storyboards and stuff.

// 1) You'll need the output of a Dump 1090 receiver, just like in the other module. This feeds the plane locations.
// 2) Add a storyboard, throw a MapView on it. Name it 'myMapView', and I think that should do it.

// The Cron.php is a file to query my home network for the aircraft data, and save it to a file on my hosted server for dissemination.
